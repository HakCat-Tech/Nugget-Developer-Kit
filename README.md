This repository contains KiCAD design files for the WiFi Nugget Developer Kit PCB.  The current version of this release is `2.1`.
This kit is designed to teach beginners basic hardware assembly skills, and features both through-hole and surface mount components.

### Features
This kit is designed to work with the [Wemos "mini" form factor](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/), and accomodates breakouts for the ESP8266, ESP32-S2, and some other Espressif based board designs.
